      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h3>
        How is a personal astrology reading different from the horoscopes you
        see in magazine?
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Personal astrology readings are highly individualised and based on the
          precise details of your birth, offering deeper insights and guidance.
          Magazine horoscopes, on the other hand, are general and entertaining,
          but they lack the depth, personalization, and accuracy of a personal
          astrology reading. It's important to approach both with a critical
          mindset, recognising that astrology is a belief system and not a
          science.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What is the difference between Western and Vedic Astrology</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Vedic astrology has its own unique methods and calculations that
          differ from western astrology. While both systems use the zodiac
          signs, they interpret them and the positions of celestial bodies
          differently. Vedic astrology uses moon signs whilst western astrology
          uses sun signs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How can a vedic astrology reading help me?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Vedic astrology is an ancient system of astrology that has its roots
          in the Vedas, the sacred texts of India. It is able to provide
          insights into various aspects of your life, including your
          personality, relationships, career, and more, based on the positions
          of celestial bodies at the time of your birth. Here's how Vedic
          astrology can help you:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Self-awareness:</strong> Vedic astrology can provide you
              with a better understanding of your personality, strengths,
              weaknesses, and natural inclinations. By knowing yourself more
              deeply, you can make informed decisions and work on personal
              development.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Life guidance:</strong> Vedic astrology can offer guidance
              on various life decisions, such as career choices, education, and
              major life events. An astrologer can analyze your birth chart to
              provide insights into your potential career path, suitable
              professions, and the best timing for important life events.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Relationship compatibility:</strong> Vedic astrology is
              often used to assess the compatibility between individuals in
              romantic, business, or familial relationships. It can help you
              understand the dynamics of your relationships and make choices
              that lead to more harmonious and fulfilling connections.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Timing and forecasting:</strong> Vedic astrology can be
              used for predictive purposes, helping you anticipate and prepare
              for significant life events or challenges. Astrologers can provide
              insights into auspicious times for starting new ventures, getting
              married, or making important decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Health and well-being:</strong> Astrology can also be used
              to assess your overall health and potential vulnerabilities based
              on the positions of celestial bodies. This information can be used
              as a complementary approach to holistic health and well-being.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Spiritual growth:</strong> Vedic astrology is often
              intertwined with spirituality and can guide individuals on their
              spiritual journeys. It can provide insights into your spiritual
              path, meditation practices, and methods for personal growth.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What is my Vedic birth chart?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This chart will display the positions of the sun, moon, and planets in
          the signs and houses of the zodiac at the time of your birth. Elna
          will use this chart to interpret significance and its impact on
          various aspects of your life.
