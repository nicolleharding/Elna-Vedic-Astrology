                1. How is a personal astrology reading different from the
                horoscopes you see in magazines?

            </div>
            <div class="accordion__answer">
              <p>
                Personal astrology readings are highly individualised and based
                on the precise details of your birth, offering deeper insights
                and guidance. Magazine horoscopes, on the other hand, are
                general and entertaining, but they lack the depth,
                personalization, and accuracy of a personal astrology reading.
                It's important to approach both with a critical mindset,
                recognising that astrology is a belief system and not a science.

                Vedic astrology has its own unique methods and calculations that
                differ from western astrology. While both systems use the zodiac
                signs, they interpret them and the positions of celestial bodies
                differently. Vedic astrology uses moon signs whilst western
                astrology uses sun signs.

                Vedic astrology is an ancient system of astrology that has its
                roots in the Vedas, the sacred texts of India. It is able to
                provide insights into various aspects of your life, including
                your personality, relationships, career, and more, based on the
                positions of celestial bodies at the time of your birth. Here's
                how Vedic astrology can help you:
                <br />
                1. Relationship compatibility: Vedic astrology is often used to
                assess the compatibility between individuals in romantic,
                business, or familial relationships. It can help you understand
                the dynamics of your relationships and make choices that lead to
                more harmonious and fulfilling connections.
                <br />
                2. Timing and forecasting: Vedic astrology can be used for
                predictive purposes, helping you anticipate and prepare for
                significant life events or challenges. Astrologers can provide
                insights into auspicious times for starting new ventures,
                getting married, or making important decisions.
                <br />
                3. Health and well-being: Astrology can also be used to assess
                your overall health and potential vulnerabilities based on the
                positions of celestial bodies. This information can be used as a
                complementary approach to holistic health and well-being.
                <br />
                4. Spiritual growth: Vedic astrology is often intertwined with
                spirituality and can guide individuals on their spiritual
                journeys. It can provide insights into your spiritual path,
                meditation practices, and methods for personal growth.

            <div class="accordion__answer">
              <p>
                It is best to highlight any questions your may want answered
                when booking a consultation, so Elna can keep this in mind when
                preparing your chart reading.

                5. Why Is Having The Exact Birth Time So Important When Casting
                A Chart?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion__answer">
              <p>
                It is impossible to create a person's chart without knowing
                their birth time. One can understand this with the example that
                year of birth is like city name, date of birth is like street
                name, and the time of birth is like house number. If the house
                number is not given one can reach very near to it, but will not
                be able to enter in the home.

            <div class="accordion__answer">
              <p>
                Your Vedic birth chart shows the relationship between your life
                and the Universe, your connection to the Cosmos, and your
                Dharma. It is essentially a map of your karmas and a mirror of
                your soul's destiny in this lifetime. Vedic Astrology is the
                only method that allows this link to be expressed in cycles of
                time. This system provides a way to forecast future trends and
                occurrences related to health, career, finances, family,
                relationships, and spiritual progress.
                <br />
                The ancient Indian texts known as the Vedas state that our
                current life and the next one we live will be shaped by our
                former lives' good or bad deeds, or Karma.
                <br />
                Based on a worldwide religion, Vedic Astrology holds that the
                soul travels through many bodies in search of greater.

              <p>
                Numerous particular Vedic treatments, known as Upayes, can be
                employed to mitigate the effects of our difficult karma. These
                remedies include mantras, meditation, yoga, yantras, fasting,
                diet, herbs, charity, service, worship, and prayer. In addition,
                certain astrological flaws and challenging karma, such as health
                issues, can be relieved by particular Vedic rites (pujas and
                yagyas) and gem stones.
