              belongs to a traditional family of astrologers in Puri, Orissa,
              tracing their lineage back to Śri Achyutānanda Das. There she
              received a certification in the Parāśara JyotiṣaProgram as Jyotiṣa

            <h2 class="about-elna bold">Why Vedic Astrology</h2>
            <p>
              Astrology is a science that deals with time. The Sun, Moon and
              planets are constantly in motion with respect to earth and
              therefore the signatures of time.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Western Astrology is based on the fixed Tropical zodiac and the
              movement of the Sun. Its focus is mainly on the Sun and is based
              into categorising birth into the 12 solar months in a year.
              Although used in personal, financial, predictive and other
              analyses, the tropical zodiac is most accurate in predicting
              seasonal weather patterns and when it is most likely to be
              disturbed. Outer planets are included in casting a birth chart.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Vedic Astrology, known in Sanskrit as Jyotish, is called the
              science of light, it is an ancient science that goes back
              thousands of years and are understood to be one of the six limbs
              of the Vedas known as the ‘eye of the Vedas’, the earliest body of
              the Indian scriptures. It is based on the Sidereal zodiac showing
              the exact position of the planets in the sky, and only planets
              that can be seen with the naked eye are used in casting a birth
              chart. There are 27 constellations (Nakṣatra), and not just the 12
              star-signs that form the core of western understanding of
              celestial influences on planet earth.

              <em
                >Jyotish without Nakṣatra is as incomplete as the human body is
                without eyes. If Jyotish is the eye of the Vedas, then Nakṣatra
                are the eyes of Jyotish – Prash Trivedi</em
