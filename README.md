- Removed Gallery page due to time contraints and assignment requirements.

## Existing Features (In Scope)

**Navigation Bar**
- Positioned on top right of the page next to the logo which is on the left of the page and the nav bar on the right. The nav bar item selected is underline when on the page, and moves to the next page as the user hovers on that nav selection.
- The responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page, FAQs page and Book page which is fully responsive and identical on each page for easy of use.

**Footer**
- Set on a blue background, the footer includes the email address and the social links centered on the page. The links are clickable and navigate to the desired destination in a new tab, with the email opening up a new email.
- The footer remains the same on each page of the website.

**The Landing Page (Home page)**
- Cover hero image of moon in night sky, with text that highlights services Elna offers and gives the user more information on what Vedic Astrology is. Included is a button to help users navigate to the Book page. This is to increase awareness of call to action and highlight why the user would want to enquire for a consultation.
- About Elna - Photo of Elna positioned on the left hand side to build trust and approachability with the familiarity of a photo. 
- The section includes a descriptive write up of Elna's experience, how she started with Vedic Astrology and her study experience. Many people may not know what Vedic Astrology is.
- To highlight to the user why they would want Vedic Astrology over Western Astrology, I have included a Why Vedic Astrology section on this page.

**FAQs**
- Centered at the top of the page is an accordion FAQs section. The questions are designed to be clickable exposing the answers. A hand appears on the scroller to ensure the user knows to click on the question box. This creates a better user experience as it is more visually appealing.
- At the bottom of the FAQs page is an image of the zodiac on a black star sky. Overlayed on this image is the upcoming festivals and fasts for the next quarter.

**Book**
- Set on a background of stars in the galaxy, the "Book a Consultation" form includes collection fields of name, email, contact number, consult date and a message box. The email box is set to only accept email details. All boxes are required other than the message box.
- I have intentionally left off the price of a consultation as this is variable depending on country and the clients (Elna) preference.
- Under the boxes is a "Book Now" button, which sends the data collected directly to Elna via email.
- Included in the form is what a user will need to share for a consultation and what to expect. The for main points of the "What to Expect" content are in bold and purple to visually catch the users eye and highlight these points.

# Deployment

## Adding and Committing Files
These are the steps that were followed:
  1. Typed "git add" in the command line. Use "." to add a new change to a file. 
  2. Then typed "git commit" to commit these files to the repository with a comment. To add a comment I typed -m "With a detailed explanation of the change you have made". I did this on a regular basis to ensure I had versions of changes, should I need to go back to a previous version. I struggled with this in the beginning as Codeanywhere had significant delays, but since changing to writing code in Git Pod this has been resolved. 
  3. Typed "git push" to push these changes to Git Hub from Codeanywhere of Git Pod.
  4. After adding wireframe, text and images to website, before I started troubleshooting bugs I deployed the website. This is because some styling looks different on a deployed website to the staging area.  

## File Paths
  1. Used the file's path, such as assets/css/style.css or index.html, to add a single file. Used ../ before image files to ensure the file path was relative. 

## Deployment Process
  1. Decided when the right time was to deploy, as discussed above. 
  2. Pushed all updated to Git Hub.
  3. Logged in with Git Hub.
  4. Selected "Settings" from the menu that was displayed in Gut Hub.
  5. Navigated to the "Pages" section on the left hand side of the screen, under the "Code and Automation" section. 
  6. Clicked "None" in the dropdown menu under "Source" and choose "Main Branch".
  7. To find the now-published site link, go back down the page to the "GitHub Pages" section.
  8. Select deployed page from the Git Hub Pages section or the quick link on the right hand side of the main page.
